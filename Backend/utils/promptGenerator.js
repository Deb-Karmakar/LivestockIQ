    Mission:
    - To digitize livestock health records for better compliance, animal welfare, and productivity.
    
    Core User Flow:
    - A Farmer logs animal details and creates treatment records.
    - Their supervising Veterinarian receives a notification, reviews the treatment, and digitally approves it, which emails a PDF prescription to the farmer.
    - A Regulator views aggregated, anonymized data (trends, heatmaps) for regional oversight.
    - An Admin manages the system, users, and data integrity.

    Key Features:
    - Multi-Role System: Tailored dashboards for Farmers, Vets, Regulators, and Admins.
    - Animal & Treatment Logging: Farmers create detailed records for vet approval.
    - Vet Verification: Vets approve/reject treatments and set official withdrawal periods.
    - Automated Alerts: System automatically warns farmers of upcoming withdrawal dates, high AMU spikes, and potential disease risks based on weather.
    - Sales & Inventory Management: Farmers can log sales (only for safe animals) and track drug inventory.
    - Animal History Timeline: A complete, chronological view of an animal's life.
    - Regulator Dashboards: High-level views of regional AMU trends, compliance rates, and geospatial heatmaps.
